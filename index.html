<h1>This is a demo</h1>
<p>git is version control software on your computer.</p>
<p>We COMMIT our code version to git on our computer.</p>
<p>github.com is a cloud service that works with git to help us collaborate with other coders.</p>
<p>We PUSH our code to github.com to collaborate with other coders.</p>
<p>We DEPLOY our projects to a server so that the world can view them in a browser on a computer, tablet or phone.
<p>In the bootcamp we DEPLOY to the bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu server</p>
<p>DEPLOY and PUSH are DIFFERENT!!!</p>
